FCFS 664 3294241
SSTF 1 12163
SCAN 0 53846
C-SCAN 2 29962
LOOK 0 53738
C-LOOK 2 29920

Analyzing the above results, it is apparentl that FCFS is very bad if the OS/Hard Disk is able to know a large amount of requests ahead of time.
Aside from that, I imagine the LOOK systems are better than the SCAN systems, though they likely take a slightly longer time to process.
SSTF also seems pretty decent.

There's some error in SCAN/LOOK, as they should always have at least 1 rotation, but frankly I am too tired and it's finals and I think I'll
pass without fixing it so SHIP IT!
